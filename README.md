# inAn E-commerce Website Pattern Library

---

## Brief

*inAn* is a fictitious e-commerce website that sells artworks printed on a variety of print-on-demand products. *inAn* is built on a vibrant community of creatives and art & design enthusiasts who, with love and passion, helped keep *inAn* growing.

This project is part of the [Graphic Design](https://www.algonquincollege.com/mediaanddesign/program/graphic-design/) curriculum at Algonquin College. It showcases a designer's abilities to create and work with a pattern library to build a multi-page website, as well as demonstrating their understanding of web design in general.
