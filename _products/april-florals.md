  Why April? Well, for some reason mid-spring time fascinates me more than any. So one day as I was waiting for the train to go home I stopped by this small flower field close by then made several paintings of these beautiful red flowers. Later that day my mom worried sick, but hey I got her some of my paintings and she liked it!
